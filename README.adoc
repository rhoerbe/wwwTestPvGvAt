# Static Website Content for www.test.wpv.portalverbund.at

This is the source repository for the web site. The toolchain is as follows:

1. The sources are maintained in the master branch of this repo using asciidoc with jekyll hints.
2. The build process uses travis-ci to build the html, using following compontents:
   ** jekyll/asciidoc packaged in a docker image (source: rhoerbe/jekyll.adoc@github)
   ** script in .travis.yml
   ** git scripting to upload the generated html to the gh-pages branch
   ** The ssh key material is bundled with the repo (-> .ssh/). The passphrase is contained in the
      travis-ci account.
3. The web server serving the site needs to git pull the gh-pages repo in regular intervals
